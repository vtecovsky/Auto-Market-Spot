# RestAPI for marketplace named "Auto Market Spot"

<br>This project was done using the FastAPI framework. It works only on local machines with the local host and database.</br>
<br>I used PostgreSQL as a database management system with SQLAlchemy (ORM) requests.</br>
<br>This API supports user authorization and registration, creating, updating, and deleting items for the marketplace.</br>
